#smooth.vim
A dark colorscheme for Vim.

  I wanted a low contrast scheme but none of them would fit. So the best way to solve this was to create my own.
  It was inspired by [kolor](https://github.com/zeis/kolor).
  I don't plan to change this scheme, only upgrade it with more groups & customizations.

##Installation
Use any plugin manager that you like, but I recommend [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). It's easy to manage plugins with it.
